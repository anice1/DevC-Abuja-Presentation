## About our dataset


    Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.
    Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

    Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

## Task
Create a model for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure. <br>
12 clinical features for predicting death events.


## Our Machine Learning WorkFlow

I feel a lot comfortable defining my workflow for solving a machine learning problem before ever starting to solve those problem as that gives me a feel of direction. However, this may be different for someother persons ‚úçüèª

**Below are the steps we are going to take to solve this machine learning problem**
1. Problem Definition and Data Collection
    
2. Get the data ready for use (Data Preprocessing)
    * Check for missing values
    * Fill missing values, if any.
    * Turn categorical Features to Numerical
3. Feature Engineering: 
   Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data. A feature is a property shared by independent units on which analysis or prediction is to be done. Features are used by predictive models and influence results.
   
4. Modeling
5. Make Predictions
6. Evaluate Model Performance metrics
7. See if we need to improve our model
8. Export our trained model
9. Load our trained model
